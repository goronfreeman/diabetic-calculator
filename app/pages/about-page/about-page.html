        <a href="http://diabeticfootonline.com/">SALSA's</a> Diabetic Foot Online Clinical Utilization Score (DFocus) is a
        free tool, to be used for the estimated calculation of resources needed to treat patients in a particular area.
        The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has updated information available from a 2011 database available
        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/index.html">Here</a>, which will allow you to use known information
        about specific countries and regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this calculator is to suggest the utilization of the already present scientific data, to provide an easy
        to use, yet functional calculator/algorithm for a health provider to best organize and plan their resources when
        treating the diabetic population. Using this system will allow a physician to predict the number of diagnosis
        specific visits to be expected from his or her diabetic community in a given year.  It is our hope that this system
        will aid the healthcare community in administrative planning and overhead. For more information about this
        calculator or about innovations in the treatment of diabetes, visit us at:
